# Buddha_Statue_Segmentation_with_Statue_Head_Mask_YOLOv8
This is a combination of a segmentation model and a detection model trained on seated Buddha Statue dataset collected from Google Images based on YOLO v8. This can be used to segment seated Buddha Statue objects from images, and then add a mask to the statue head. This is expected to be used as inputs to an inpainting work based on GAN.
